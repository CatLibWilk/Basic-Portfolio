                      I'm a Library and information sciences professional with strong interests in cataloging, metadata, and information technology. My classroom and work experiences have given me the opportunity to perform cataloging work for a wide range of resource and material types, while utilizing a wide range of descriptive schemas and metadata standards. I am particularly interested 
                      in applying my cataloging knowledge to describe and provide access to cultural heritage collections, with an eye toward future concepts and technologies.
